# angular2-webpack-seed
A starter kit featuring Angular 2, Router, TypeScript, and Webpack by [AngularClass](https://angularclass.com)

## Use latest TypeScript compiler
TypeScript 1.5 beta includes everything you need. Make sure to upgrade, even if you installed TypeScript previously.

    $ npm install -g typescript@^1.5.0-beta


### install
```bash
$ npm webpack -global
$ npm webpack-dev-server -global
$ npm install
```

### server
```bash
$ npm run server
```

### auto build files
```bash
$ npm run watch
```


## .d.ts Typings
The typings in `typings/angular2/` are partially autogenerated, partially hand
written. All the symbols should be present, but probably have wrong paramaters
and missing members. Modify them as you go.


## Use a TypeScript-aware editor
We have good experience using these editors:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [Webstorm 10](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/download/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) with [TypeScript plugin](https://atom.io/packages/atom-typescript)
* [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/3) with [Typescript-Sublime-Plugin](https://github.com/Microsoft/Typescript-Sublime-plugin#installation)



### Todo
